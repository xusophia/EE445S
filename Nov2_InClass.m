% Consider performing an iterative minimization of objective function

% J(x) = x^2 – 14x + 49 = (x - 7)^2

% via the steepest descent algorithm (JSK equation (6.5) on page 116).

% The value of x at the (k+1)st iteration is given by the update equation

%  x[k+1] = x[k] - mu ( dJ(x) / dx ) where x is replaced by x[k].

%

% a. Visualize and analyze the shape of the objective function J(x).

%     1) Plot J(x) for 5 < x < 9. Give the Matlab code for your answer.

 x = [5 : 0.01 : 9];
 J = x.^2 - 14*x + 49 ;

 plot(x, J);

%     2) Describe the plot.

%         Answer: %% parabola, concave up, with minimum at x = 7

%     3) How many local minima do you see and what are their values?

%         Answer: One local minima at x = 7, with value 0

%     4) Of the local minima, how many are global minima?

%         Answer: The only local minima is the global minima

 

% b. As first step in deriving steepest descent update equation,

%     compute the first derivative of J(x) with respect to x.

%     Answer: dJ(x)/dx = 2*x - 14


% c. Implement the steepest descent algorithm in Matlab with x[0] = 5.

%      Modify polyconverge.m from JSK below by entering your expression for dJdx

% polyconverge.m find the minimum of J(x) via steepest descent

N=50;                      % number of iterations

mu=0.01;               % algorithm stepsize

x=zeros(1,N);              % initialize sequence of x values to zero

x(1)=5.0;                 % starting point x(1)

for k=1:N-1

  x(k+1)= x(k) - (2*x(k)-14)*mu;    % update equation.  FILL IN YOUR expression for dJ/dx.

%     1) What value of x did steepest descent reach in 50 iterations with mu=0.01?

%         Answer: x =     6.2568

%     2) What value of x did steepest descent reach in 50 iterations with mu=0.1?

%         Answer: x = 7.0

%     3) Is the above value the global minimum of J(x)? Why or why not?

%         Answer: Yes, since this objective function only has one 
%         min.
