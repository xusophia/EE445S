%%% This Matlab script will play three sounds:
%%% (1) low-frequency signal (baseband signal)
%%% (2) upconverted signal centered at a higher frequency,
%%% (3) the downconverted signal,
%%% The downconverted signal consists of the baseband
%%% signal plus some higher frequency artifacts.
%%%
%%% Note: The gong.wav file must be on your path.

%%% Read gong signal
%%% Dominant frequencies are 520 (C5), 630 and 660 Hz (E5) from
%%% ploting the spectrum: plotspec(basebandInput, 1/fs)
%%% Maximum frequency of interest, f1, is 660 Hz.
[basebandInput, fs] = audioread('gong.wav'); 
basebandInput = basebandInput'; % row to column transpose the vector 
f1 = 660; % specifying a frequency

Ts = 1/fs;                           %%% Sampling time
numSamples = length(basebandInput);
n = 1 : numSamples;
t = n * Ts;
tmax = Ts * numSamples;

%%% Upconvert using sinusoidal amplitude modulation
%%% to be centered at frequency fc
fc = 4*f1; %upconverting by f1*4
carrier = cos(2*pi*fc*t);
modulated = (1 + basebandInput).* carrier;

%%% Downconvert by sinusoidal amplitude demodulation
%%% 1. Modulate using the same carrier signal
%%%    (causes gain to be reduced by 1/2).
%%%    Assume knowledge of carrier frequency fc 
%%%    used in modulation/upconversion.
%%% 2. Apply lowpass filter to extract baseband
%%%    (and multiply by 2 of compensate for step 1).
%%%    Use averaging lowpass filter of length N
%%%    which has null bandwidth B = 2 pi / N.
%%%    In sinusoidal amplitude demodulation, baseband
%%%    bandwith in Hz is f1.  We can the solve for
%%%    N in B = 2 pi / N = 2 pi f1 / fs, which gives
%%%    N = fs / f1 (converted to integer).
carrier = cos(2*pi*fc*t);
modulateAgain = modulated .* carrier;

FIRlength = floor(fs/f1);
lowpassCoeffs = ones(1, FIRlength) / FIRlength;
basebandOutput = 2*filter(lowpassCoeffs, 1, modulateAgain);
basebandOutput = basebandOutput - mean(basebandOutput);
